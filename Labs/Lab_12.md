# Lab 12 - Covert Malware Launching

## Lab 12-1

Analyze the malware found in the file Lab12-01.exe and Lab12-01.dll. Make sure that these files are in the same directory when performing the analysis.

**1. What happens when you run the malware executable?**

Before running the sample, we are going to set up _Process Monitor_ so as to capture all traces of the malware execution, to do so, we create a new filter in which the process name will have to be the name of the malware.

![_Process Monitor_ adding filter 1](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-01_1_process_monitor_1.png)

Now, we apply the changes and we are ready to run the sample.

When we run the sample, a pop up that says "Press OK to reboot" appears, this pop up will appears every minute or so, but adding one to X at the title of the window "Practical Malware Analysis X".

This behaviour is quite anoying, so we save the _Process Monitor_ log file, reboot the machine and revert the snapshot.

Now, we can analyze the file.

Mmmmm... It seems that _Process Monitor_ does not capture all the execution with this filter. So we add another filter, in this case if the name of the _DLL_ appears in the path column (notice we have disabled the other filter).

Now, we can see that the malicious _DLL_ has been loaded by...

![_Process Monitor_ malware execution](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-01_1_process_monitor_4.png)

_Explorer.exe_!!! This is clearly an indicator of the usage of a process injection technique!

**2. What process is being injected?**

As we have previously seen in the first exercise, the targeted process seems to be _explorer.exe_, but let's analyze the malware in _IDA Pro_ so as to verify it.

At the beginning of the executable we can see how it loads _EnumProcessModules_, _GetModuleBaseNameA_ and _EnumProcesses_, which are necessary to list processes.

![_IDA Pro_ load functions](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-01_2_ida_pro_1.png)

After that, it calls the previously loaded _EnumProcesses_ function, which returns an array of the _PIDs_ of the processes of the system that we have called _processesPIDs_.

![_IDA Pro_ _EnumProcesses_ call](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-01_2_ida_pro_2.png)

Then, this array is iterated so as to find the PID of _explorer.exe_. Here, we can see where this check is done, in a function we have called _checkExplorerPID_ (_0x00401000_).

![_IDA Pro_ _checkExplorerPID_ call](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-01_2_ida_pro_3.png)

In this function we can see how the malware makes this check.

![_IDA Pro_ checking of _explorer.exe_ PID](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-01_2_ida_pro_4.png)

After that, we can see how the malware performs the process injection using the _WINAPI_ functions _VirtualAllocEx_ to allocate memory in the remote process, _WriteProcessMemory_ to write the malicious _DLL_ into the process address space and _CreateRemoteThread_ to call _LoadLibraryA_ from the remote process to load the malicious _DLL_.

**3. How can you make the malware stop the pop-ups?**

As we can see while analyzing the _DLL_, the pop ups are displayed every minute in a new thread.

![_IDA Pro_ pop up message box 1](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-01_3_ida_pro_1.png)

![_IDA Pro_ pop up message box 2](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-01_3_ida_pro_2.png)

After analyzing the function located at _0x10001030_, we can conclude that it will never stops, since it checks if _EAX_ is equal to 0, but in the previous instruction the malware has set _EAX_ to 1.

This led us to know that the only thing we can do is restarting _explorer.exe_ so as to stop malware execution, this can be done by rebooting the system for example.

**4. How does this malware operate?**

The malware enumerate the processes of the machine to find out the _PID_ of the _explorer.exe_ process, when the malware finds it, it will inject the _DLL_ _Lab12-01.dll_ into _explorer.exe_. Once the _DLL_ is loaded and executed, it will start popping up windows every minute until the user reboots the system or restarts the process _explorer.exe_.

## Lab 12-2

Analyze the malware found in the file Lab12-02.exe.

**1. What is the purpose of this program?**

First, the malware gets the path of the process _svchost.exe_, then, it loads and decrypts the resource file contained in it, this resource is a binary file. After that, the malware injects the binary file into the process _svchost.exe_.

Once the encrypted binary is executing, it starts capturing the keys pressed by the user (_keylogging_), storing the information in a file called _practicalmalwareanalysis.log_.

![_IDA Pro_ get _svchost.exe_ full path](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-02_1_ida_pro_1.png)

**2. How does the launcher program hide execution?**

The malware executes the malicious payload inside the process _svchost.exe_. This is performed by means of a process injection technique called _Process Hollowing_. This technique consist of the following phases:

1. The malware calls _CreateProcess_ to spawn the legit process _svchost.exe_, but in _suspended_ mode with the argument _dwCreationFlags_ set as 4 or _CREATE_SUSPENDED_.

![_IDA Pro_ _Process Hollowing_ 1](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-02_2_ida_pro_1.png)

2. The malware calls _NtUnmapViewOfSection_ to unmap the memory address space of the legit process where the malicious one will be placed.

![_IDA Pro_ _Process Hollowing_ 2](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-02_2_ida_pro_2.png)

3. The malware writes the malicious process into the legit one (to understand better the writing process the structures _IMAGE_DOS_HEADER_, _IMAGE_NT_HEADERS_, and _IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER_ have been added and set up).

![_IDA Pro_ _Process Hollowing_ 3](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-02_2_ida_pro_3.png)

4. When the malware ends the writing process, it resumes the thread so as to execute the delivered payload.

![_IDA Pro_ _Process Hollowing_ 4](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-02_2_ida_pro_4.png)

**3. Where is the malicious payload stored?**

The malicious payload is stored in an encrypted way as a resource file within the malware. To extract the malware, we use _Resource Hacker_ and its feature of _save as..._, in our case as _lab12-02_encrypted_payload.ex__.

**4. How is the malicious payload protected?**

The malicious payload is encrypted using the simple _XOR_ algorithm with the key equal to _0x41_ in the routine _decryptionRoutine_ at address _00401000_ as we can see in the following pictures.

![_IDA Pro_ decryption routine 1](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-02_4_ida_pro_1.png)

![_IDA Pro_ decryption routine 2](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-02_4_ida_pro_2.png)

To decrypt the resource, we are going to use the following python script that we have developed:

```
def decrypt_file():
	decrypted_bytes = bytearray()
	key = 0x41

	with open("Scripts/Others/Lab_12/lab12-02_encrypted_payload.ex_", "rb") as encrypted_file:
		encrypted_byte = encrypted_file.read(1)
		while encrypted_byte:
			decrypted_byte = int.from_bytes(encrypted_byte, byteorder="big") ^ key
			decrypted_bytes.append(decrypted_byte)
			encrypted_byte = encrypted_file.read(1)

	return decrypted_bytes

def save_decrypted_file(decrypted_bytes):
	decrypted_file = open("Scripts/Others/Lab_12/lab12-02_decrypted_payload.ex_", "wb")
	decrypted_file.write(decrypted_bytes)

decrypted_bytes = decrypt_file()
save_decrypted_file(decrypted_bytes)
```

Now, we simply execute it as follows:

```
python3 Scripts/Others/Lab_12/lab12_02_decrypt_file.py
```

Voil√†! The file has been successfully decrypted!

**5. How are strings protected?**

The payload's strings are also encrypted using the same _XOR_ encryption algorithm commented in the previous exercise, since the malware encoded the whole payload using this technique.

## Lab 12-3

Analyze the malware extracted during the analysis of Lab 12-2, or use the file Lab12-03.exe.

**1. What is the purpose of this malicious payload?**

The purpose of the malware is capturing the keys pressed by the user (_keylogging_), storing the information in a file called _practicalmalwareanalysis.log_.

![_IDA Pro_ _keylogging_ special keys](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-03_1_ida_pro_1.png)

**2. How does the malicious payload inject itself?**

The malware creates a _hook injection_ so as to capture the keystrokes of the keyboard. This _hook_ is done by means of _SetWindowsHookExA_ _WINAPI_ function.

![_IDA Pro_ _hooking_ process](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-03_2_ida_pro_1.png)

**3. What filesystem residue does this program create?**

The malware creates a file called _practicalmalwareanalysis.log_ that stores the keys pressed by the user.

![_IDA Pro_ log file](../Pictures/Lab_12/lab_12-03_3_ida_pro_1.png)

## Lab 12-4

Analyze the malware found in the file Lab12-04.exe.

**1. What does the code at 0x401000 accomplish?**

**2. Which process has code injected?**

**3. What DLL is loaded using LoadLibraryA?**

**4. What is the fourth argument passed to the CreateRemoteThread call?**

**5. What malware is dropped by the main executable?**

**6. What is the purpose of this and the dropped malware?**
